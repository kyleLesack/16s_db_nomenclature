## Manual Changes

All of the uncertain nomenclature genus names and type species were removed from the valid_genera.txt and valid_species.txt files, and added to the uncertain_genera.txt and uncertain_species.txt files.

Trichodesmium erythraeum added to species list (it was missed as there was no space between the "T:" code and the species name on the CyanoDB website
Wilmottia murrayi added to species list (it was missed as there was no space between the "T:" code and the species name on the CyanoDB website

=Sphaerospermopsis was removed from synonyms.txt. It was picked up mistakenly as there was no space separating the = character from the synonym name.
