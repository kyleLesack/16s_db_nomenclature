## Illegitimate Genera

The following genera were deemed invalid by UpToDate, but were contained on the list of valid names in LPSN.

Bacteriolyticum

Bryantella

Frondicola

Goodfellowia

Micromonas

Microsphaera

Pelczaria

Pirella

Quadricoccus

Reichenbachia

Rhizomonas

Schineria

Sinococcus

Verticia

Yania

Zimmermannella

Note: A manual review of all genera deemed invalid in UpToDate but valid in LPSN revealed that they were in fact illegitimate. Most of these were found on the LPSN valid name list, but deemed illegitimate on the taxon subpage, and were not on the LPSN list of known non-valid names.
